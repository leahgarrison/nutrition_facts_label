# On Your Own: Nutrition Facts Label

* Task: recreate the US nutrition label (html/css)

* Your task for this project is to replicate the US-style label shown below (from Wikimedia). 
*  You should strive to make it look as much like the original as possible without purchasing fonts: your font stack can use Franklin Gothic Heavy for the main heading, and Helvetica Black and Helvetica for the remaining fonts. 
*  Keep in mind that not all systems supply these fonts, so add Arial to the list, and let the browser supply a default font if necessary.

* The following label isn't the most current FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) design, but
* it's the design you should replicate.

* Our CSS uses precisely one class, though the HTML applies it to more than one element. We use no other classes and no IDs at all. See how close you can get to this in your solution. The challenge of limiting class and id selectors will push you to find other ways to identify the elements you want to select. For instance, you may need to specify adjacent siblings, use pseudo-classes (e.g., :first-of-type), and use highly specific selectors to override existing styles. Read the MDN pages on CSS Selectors before starting, and keep it handy as you work.

* While coding, be mindful of semantics; avoid the div and span elements, and supply as much semantic information as you can. Our solution does not use div or span at all; try to match that.
